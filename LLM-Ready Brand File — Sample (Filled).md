## Brand Snapshot
- **Company / Brand:** ExampleCo Marketing Ops
- **Audience:** Content marketers, content strategists, and marketing team leads using Microsoft 365/SharePoint and multiple LLMs.
- **Mission in one line:** Help B2B teams create faster, on‑brand content by standardizing AI workflows.
- **Positioning:** Practical CRM & content‑ops guidance that balances speed and governance.
- **Do / Don’t Phrases:**
  - **Do:** state your business and industry; share examples; add must‑on features; share chain of thought; define AI’s role; attach relevant docs.
  - **Don’t:** be too rigid on design; blindly adopt output without human audit.

## Voice & Style
- **Defaults:** British English; avoid em dashes; concise sentences; minimal emojis; accessibility‑friendly.
- **Tone sliders:**
  - Formality: Medium
  - Energy: Medium‑High
  - Jargon: Low‑Medium (marketing ops, not dev)
- **Sentence / Layout rules:** short paragraphs; H2/H3 sections; bullets first; include a one‑line takeaway per section.

## Facts & Claims (Reusable Truths)
> Use ONLY these facts when making claims; do not invent numbers.
- **Audience:** Content marketers, content strategists, and marketing team leads who are currently using or exploring the use of multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT‑4, Claude 3, Gemini) to accelerate content production within a Microsoft 365/SharePoint ecosystem.
- **Authority:** Recognized in the **MarTech Breakthrough Awards 2025** for the **Content Workflow Automation** solution. Head of Content **Alex Chen** is a speaker at **Content Marketing World** and **INBOUND**.
- **Impact:** Teams using the SharePoint + Multi‑LLM workflow reported a **30% reduction** in first‑draft creation time (→ internal customer case studies, Q3 2025) and a **15% increase** in topic ideation output vs. manual processes (→ internal A/B tests, Q2 2025).
- **Offer:** The blog post outlines a specific workflow: SharePoint lists for content calendars; different LLMs for distinct tasks (titles → outline → body); integrated approval flows. No direct promotional links for specific LLMs; no full downloadable script.
- **Safety:** Examples are generalized; no client or employee data. Focus on process/methodology, not proprietary code. All claims are based on documented, repeatable internal results.
- **Sources:** `SharePoint/Marketing Dept/LLM Workflows/Case Studies/Workflow Efficiency Q3 2025.docx`, **DocID:** AB‑TESTING‑IDEATION‑Q2‑25, **Alex Chen’s 2025 Speaker Decks**.

## Examples (Show‑n‑Tell)
- **Good #1:**
  > Defaults you must follow in every response: British English; avoid em dashes; concise sentences; minimal emojis; accessibility‑friendly.
  *Why it’s good:* gives universal house‑style constraints.
- **Good #2:**
  > Multi‑step workflow (Titles → Outline → Body → CTA):
  > 1) Propose 10 titles; 2) Select 3; 3) Draft outline; 4) Write first draft; 5) Add CTA options.
  *Why it’s good:* clarifies stages and expectations.
- **Bad (for contrast):**
  > “Draft me a post on the new product” + attach a 100‑page PDF.
  *Why it’s bad:* excessive, uncurated context slows/derails the model; chunk and summarize first.

## Localization & Compliance
- **Regions / Variants:** UK, US, SG — adapt idioms, spellings, and examples; keep core voice.
- **Claims rules:** cite sources listed under **Facts & Claims**; mark unknowns as `[SOURCE]` and avoid speculative numbers.
- **Approvals:** Monthly team review; Communication Head approves final edits upon mutual team decisions.

## Why Markdown (Sidebar)
- Universal across mainstream LLMs; headings/lists improve consistency.
- Easy to compare outputs (same H2 sequence each time).
- Plays well with converters (e.g., MarkItDown) and pastes cleanly into docs/Notion.

## Quick Start
1) Paste **Usage Prompt** + this file into your LLM; request output in the fixed H2 order.
2) Use the **Good/Bad** examples to calibrate.
3) Track time‑to‑first‑draft and revision count for your own baselines.
4) Update **Facts & Claims** when metrics or awards change.
